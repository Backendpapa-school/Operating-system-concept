# Process
A process is a program in execution.
1. Old systems could only load and execute one program at a time,meaning if you were to run another program, you have to unload the previous program and load a new one to be executed.
2. Multisystems allowed loading of multiple programs and executing them all concurrently.
3. we can say that a system is a collection of processes.

## Process structure.
Process is made up of 4 structures, the text section, the data section, the heap section and the stack section
